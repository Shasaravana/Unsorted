	1. For each column: mean, median, mode
	2. Above Average, Below Average

Univariate Analysis: How it affects the output column

Bivariate Analysis: How the combination of two variables affects the output column

Input Split: Save it as CSV file Train data and Test data

Models: Base Model Selection 

Select two or three models

On selected base models: do hyperparameter fine tuning

1. Use your intuition and write reasons for it

2. Use grid search

Tabluate the predictions and create charts
